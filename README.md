# Readme

"cornflakes-linter" is a wrapper for `flake8`.

**added `onType` linting (0.5)**

VSCode already has flake8 integration HOWEVER it doesn't play nicely with
flake8 plugins &mdash; the regex doesn't parse the output correctly. This means that the
errors/warnings/information do not show up in the problems tab. This extension rectifies
that.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have installed flake8

```bash
 pip install flake8
```

2. Set the path to the flake8 in `settings.json` (or search in the vscode settings tab).

```json
{
 "cornflakes.linter.executablePath": "path/to/venvs/myvenv/bin/flake8"
}
```

3. Open a `.py` file and then save it and the extension will run showing all of the lint issues (inline and in the problems tab).

## Configuration

### For the extension

You need to include the full path to the flake8 executable that you wish to use.

To find the path to the appropriate flake8, you can _(on *nix)_ use `which` as follows.

```bash
which flake8
```

In Windows, try using `where.exe`

```cmd
where.exe flake8
```

Then copy that path to `settings.json`

```json
{
 "cornflakes.linter.executablePath": "path/to/venvs/myvenv/bin/flake8"
}
```

#### Change when the linter is run

You have options to decide when to re-lint the current file &mdash; *on save* or *on type*. All settings are available through the settings page, or the json.

```json
{
 "cornflakes.linter.run": "onType"
}
```

### Flake8 configuration

The way to configure flake8 extensions / settings / ignores and all other configuration
for flake8 is by using the standard [flake8 configuration](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html)
rules. The extension will be run from the root directory of the workspace.

Personally, I like a `tox.ini` in the workspace root.

```ini
[flake8]
ignore = E226,E302,E41
max-line-length = 88
exclude = tests/*
max-complexity = 10
```
